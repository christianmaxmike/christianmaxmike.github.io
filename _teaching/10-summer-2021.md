In many modern application areas, data scientists face challenges which go beyond the basic 
techniques being introduced in the basic module Knowledge Discovery in Databases I. The module 
Knowledge Discovery in Databases II covers advanced techniques to handle large data volumes, 
volatile data streams, complex object descriptions and linked data. These topics are also known 
as the three major challenges (Volume, Velocity, Variety) in Big Data Analysis. The module is 
directed at master students being interested in developing and designing knowledge discovery 
processes for various types of applications. This includes the development of new data mining 
and data preprocessing methods as well as the ability to select the best suited established 
approach for a given practical challenge.
