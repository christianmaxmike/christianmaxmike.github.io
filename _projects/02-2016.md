## About
Online convex optimization can be considered as a process. In several research fiels including information theory and machine
learning, signal and image processing, data analysis, the environment of practical application is so complex that it is 
infeasible to formulate a theoretical model and use classical algorithmic theory and mathematical optimization. By using tools 
of online learning, the goal is to minimize the prediction error with incoming datasets given the knowledge of the previous 
data and possibly additional available information.
