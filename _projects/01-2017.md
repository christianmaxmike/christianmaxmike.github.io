## About
Most real systems consist of multi-typed entities/objects with a variety of relationships between interacting and/or 
associated objects. These interactions and relationships between entities are naturally represented as information network 
graphs. Information networks are ubiquitous and well-established in the real world with examples such as publication networks, 
communication networks, the World Wide Web, or social networks. Nowadays, we have to handle a size of these information networks 
with ranges from hundreds up to millions and billions of nodes. By the rise of data integration, an increasing attention to 
information networks in academia and industry have been observed. Recently, new challenges have been introduced as we are not 
only concentrating on homogeneous data, but are rather faced to heterogeneous data derived from a variety of sources. A lot of 
information gets lost when scaling such information networks down to traditional homogeneous networks. Heterogeneous information 
networks (HINs) which got a lot of attraction in diverse application fields, provide a more general, natural, and rich 
representation of relationships between objects and semantic information than traditional networks. Consequently, the problem 
of understanding the vast amount of information modeled in HINs has received a lot of interest.
