## About
Reliable propagation of information through large networks, e.g. communication networks, social networks or sensor networks is very important in many applications including social service applications, marketing applications, and scientific applications. However, communication between network nodes involves some application specific communication cost and may fail. Exhaustive dissemination of information through the network maximizes the probability of successful information propagation, but is quite expensive and not applicable in very large networks.
