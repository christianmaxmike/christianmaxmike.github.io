## Abstract
Spectral clustering is one of the most advantageous clustering approaches. However, standard Spectral Clustering is sensitive 
to noisy input data and has a high runtime complexity. Tackling one of these problems often exacerbates the other. As real-world 
datasets are often large and compromised by noise, we need to improve both robustness and runtime at once. Thus, we propose 
Spectral Clustering - Accelerated and Robust (SCAR), an accelerated, robustified spectral clustering method. In an iterative 
approach, we achieve robustness by separating the data into two latent components: cleansed and noisy data. We accelerate the 
eigendecomposition - the most time-consuming step - based on the Nyström method. We compare SCAR to related recent state-of-the-art 
algorithms in extensive experiments. SCAR surpasses its competitors in terms of speed and clustering quality on highly noisy data.
