## Abstract
Efficient data propagation in a computer network The invention refers to a method and system and a control node (10) for propagating data in a technical network (NW) by considering runtime requirements. A component tree (CT) data structure is generated for a probabilistic graph (G) representing the technical network (NW) and its technical constraints. On the component tree (CT) a propagation algorithm is applied, which iteratively determines an optimal edge in the generated component tree (CT), which maximizes an expected information flow to a query node (Q) to and/or from each network node by considering the technical network constraints and re-estimates the expected information flow in the updated component tree for providing a result (r) with nodes in the technical network (NW) for data propagation, so that information flow is maximized by considering technical network constraints.
