## Abstract
In temporal Knowledge Graphs (tKGs), the temporal dimension is attached to facts in a knowledge base resulting in quadruples 
between entities such as (Nintendo, released, Super Mario, Sep-13-1985), where the predicate holds within a time interval or 
at a timestamp. We propose a reinforcement learning agent gathering temporal relevant information about the query entities' 
neighborhoods, simultaneously. We refer to the encodings of the explored graph structures as fingerprints which are used as 
input to a Q-network. Our agent decides sequentially which relation type needs to be explored next to expand the local subgraphs 
of the query entities. Our evaluation shows that the proposed method yields competitive results compared to state-of-the-art 
embedding algorithms for tKGs, and we additionally gain information about the relevant structures between subjects and objects.
