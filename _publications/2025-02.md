## Abstract
Process mining aims to extract and analyze insights
from event logs, yet algorithm metric results vary widely depending 
on structural event log characteristics. Existing work
often evaluates algorithms on a fixed set of real-world event logs
but lacks a systematic analysis of how event log characteristics
impact algorithms individually. Moreover, since event logs are
generated from processes, where characteristics co-occur, we
focus on associational rather than causal effects to assess how
strong the overlapping individual characteristic affects evaluation
metrics without assuming isolated causal effects, a factor often
neglected by prior work. We introduce SHAining, the first
approach to quantify the marginal contribution of varying event
log characteristics to process mining algorithms’ metrics. Using
process discovery as a downstream task, we analyze over 22,000
event logs covering a wide span of characteristics to uncover
which affect algorithms across metrics (e.g., fitness, precision,
complexity) the most. Furthermore, we offer novel insights about
how the value of event log characteristics correlates with their
contributed impact, assessing the algorithm’s robustness.
